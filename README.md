### What I learned

This challenge was quite interesting! I really enjoyed figuring out and working on this contact form challenge. I learned a lot of features, including form validation and styling, to achieve the final goal. It was an amazing challenge, and now I am proud of myself for reaching a satisfying design outcome.

One of the struggles I had was figuring out how to achieve the radio button design. So, I researched it until I got it to work. Hereâ€™s how you can do the same! 

The following CSS code customizes the appearance of radio buttons by styling the label::before pseudo-element.


```css
input[type="radio"] + label::before {
    content: "";
    display: inline-block;
    width: 20px;
    height: 20px;
    border: 1px solid #333;
    border-radius: 50%; /* Make it circular */
    background-color: white;
    margin-right: 8px;
    vertical-align: middle;
    transition: background 0.3s, border 0.3s, box-shadow 0.3s;
}

/* When the radio button is checked */
input[type="radio"]:checked + label::before {
    background-color: hsl(169, 82%, 27%);
    border-color: hsl(169, 82%, 27%);
    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 5px white; /* Inner circle effect */
}

```
